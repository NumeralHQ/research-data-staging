# Research Data Aggregation - TODO

## ✅ COMPLETED (100% Implementation + Production Deployment)

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure & Setup**
- ✅ Google Cloud project setup with service account authentication
- ✅ AWS Lambda function deployed with proper IAM roles
- ✅ S3 bucket configured with encryption and lifecycle policies
- ✅ Environment variables configured for Google API authentication
- ✅ **Codebase cleanup**: Removed redundant directories and files
  - ✅ Removed duplicate `/lambda-layer` directory
  - ✅ Removed duplicate `requirements-lambda.txt` file
  - ✅ Created unified `build.py` script for deployment
  - ✅ Updated SAM template to reference correct deployment structure

### 🔧 **Core Implementation**
- ✅ All Python modules implemented with simplified dependencies
- ✅ Google Drive API client with rate limiting and error handling
- ✅ Google Sheets API client with header caching optimization
- ✅ Row mapping logic with percentage parsing and geocode lookup
- ✅ Async worker pattern with configurable concurrency
- ✅ Pacific Time timezone handling for file naming
- ✅ CSV generation with exact column ordering and quote formatting
- ✅ Error handling and logging with AWS Powertools

### 📊 **Data Processing**
- ✅ Header mapping optimization (read once, reuse for all sheets)
- ✅ Admin column filtering ("Tag Level" rows only)
- ✅ Business/Personal record generation (2 records per row)
- ✅ Percentage parsing (handles "100%" → "1.000000" conversion)
- ✅ Geocode lookup from state names in filenames
- ✅ Tax category mapping to 2-character codes
- ✅ Customer field mapping (Business="BB", Personal="99")

### 🎨 **CSV Formatting (✅ COMPLETED)**
- ✅ **Quote wrapping**: All CSV values wrapped in quotes (`"value"`)
- ✅ **Empty values**: Properly formatted as quoted empty strings (`""`)
- ✅ **Header quoting**: Column headers also wrapped in quotes
- ✅ **Quote escaping**: Internal quotes escaped by doubling (`"` becomes `""`)
- ✅ **Effective date**: New `EFFECTIVE_DATE` environment variable (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- ✅ **CSV generation fix**: Resolved escaping errors with manual CSV construction
- ✅ **Production validation**: Successfully generating 11,730 quoted records

### 🔒 **Security & Authentication**
- ✅ Google Service Account with keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ AWS IAM roles with least-privilege access
- ✅ S3 bucket security with encryption and public access blocking
- ✅ Input validation and error handling throughout

### 📦 **Deployment & Build**
- ✅ Simplified build process with single `build.py` script
- ✅ Optimized deployment package (33.4MB without Pydantic)
- ✅ SAM template updated for correct deployment structure
- ✅ ZIP creation utility for Lambda deployment
- ✅ Clean repository structure with no redundant files

## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION (✅ COMPREHENSIVE)

### ✅ **Completed Testing**
- ✅ **Import validation** (`test_imports.py`) - all modules load correctly
- ✅ **Basic functionality** (`test_imports.py`) - core logic working without external dependencies  
- ✅ **Model validation** (`test_models.py`) - Record creation, validation, and CSV output
- ✅ **Geocode lookup** (`test_geocode.py`) - state name extraction from filenames
- ✅ **CSV formatting** (`test_csv_formatting.py`) - quoted values and effective date configuration
- ✅ **Concurrency validation** (`test_concurrent_fix.py`) - thread pool enables true parallel processing
- ✅ **Percentage parsing** - handles "100%" → "1.000000" conversion
- ✅ **Customer field mapping** - Business="BB", Personal="99" verified
- ✅ **CSV output format** - all values properly quoted with escaping
- ✅ **Deployment package creation** - build process and structure validated
- ✅ **Local testing environment** - `test_config.env` for development

### ✅ **Production Testing & Validation**
- ✅ **Google API Integration**: Service account authentication working with real Google APIs
- ✅ **Lambda Function**: Successfully processing 51 Google Sheets files
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Generating 11,730 properly formatted CSV records
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust processing with comprehensive error logging
- ✅ **Performance**: 20-30 second processing time (5x improvement over sequential)
- ✅ **CSV Output**: All values properly quoted and escaped
- ✅ **S3 Upload**: Successfully uploading matrix_append.csv, product_item_append.csv, and static data files to timestamped folders

## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT (✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL)

### ✅ **Production Ready & Deployed**
- ✅ All source code implemented, tested, and deployed
- ✅ Infrastructure templates deployed and operational
- ✅ Security configuration finalized and validated
- ✅ Monitoring and logging configured and working
- ✅ Build and deployment process streamlined and documented
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive and up-to-date

### ✅ **Production Performance Metrics**
- ✅ **Processing Speed**: 20-30 seconds for 51 files (vs 157 seconds sequential)
- ✅ **Concurrency**: True parallel processing with thread pool executor
- ✅ **Data Volume**: Successfully processing 11,730 records per run
- ✅ **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
- ✅ **CSV Quality**: All values properly quoted and formatted
- ✅ **S3 Integration**: Reliable upload to timestamped output folders

### ✅ **Final Production Validation**
- ✅ **Build Package**: `python build.py` - working and optimized
- ✅ **Deploy Infrastructure**: Lambda function operational in us-west-2
- ✅ **Upload Mapping Files**: Lookup tables available in S3 bucket
- ✅ **Test Lambda Function**: Successfully processing real Google Sheets data
- ✅ **Monitor Execution**: CloudWatch logs and metrics working correctly
