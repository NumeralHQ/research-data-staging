# TODO – Research Data Aggregation Service

> Use GitHub issues / milestones to track progress.  The checklist below reflects **MVP → Production** order.

## 0️⃣  Pre-work
- [X] Confirm Google Drive folder access & quota limits (Sheets/min/day, Drive QPS).
- [X] Provide list of states & expected volume to estimate memory/runtime.
- [X] Decide on Lambda trigger (manual, cron, SNS, etc.).

## 1️⃣  Infrastructure (IaC)
- [X] Choose stack tool (AWS SAM / CDK / Terraform) and scaffold `infrastructure/`.
- [X] Create S3 bucket `research-aggregation` if not present 👆.
- [X] Define IAM role with least-privilege policies.
- [X] Provision Secrets Manager secrets for:
      * ~~`research/gsuite/credentials`~~ (Replaced with Workload Identity Federation)
      * ~~`research/gsuite/delegated_user`~~ (Not needed with WIF)
- [X] Add S3 prefixes: `mapping/`, `errors/`, validate bucket policy.
- [X] EventBridge schedule rule (weekly Sundays 2am PT) plus manual invoke permission.
- [X] CloudWatch metric filter + alarm for log pattern `Error: Processing` → SNS.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to lint, test, and deploy on main branch.

## 2️⃣  Core Library
- [X] `src/config.py` – Simplified env var loader (no Pydantic) with WIF support.
- [X] `src/drive_client.py` – wrapper for Drive file listing with exponential back-off.
- [X] `src/sheets_client.py` – wrapper for Sheets API, supporting reading specific ranges with header caching.
- [X] `src/models.py`
    - [X] `Record` class for CSV output with validation (simplified, no Pydantic).
    - [X] Enumerations for fixed codes (customer="BB" for business, "99" for personal).
    - [X] `LookupTables` class with S3/local fallback for mapping files.
- [X] Unit tests @ 90%+ coverage with realistic test data.
- [X] **Dependency cleanup**: Removed Pydantic dependencies for Lambda compatibility.

## 3️⃣  Lambda Runtime
- [X] `src/orchestrator.py`
    - [X] Initial step: Read header row from the first sheet in the folder.
    - [X] Create a header-to-index mapping based on `HEADER_ROW_IDX` and `COL_*` env vars.
    - [X] Pass this header map to each worker.
    - [X] Fan-out/fan-in logic with `asyncio.Semaphore` (bounded concurrency).
    - [X] Generate output key `research-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.csv` using America/Los_Angeles tz.
    - [X] On exceptions store skipped sheet info in `errors/errors-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.json` and continue.
- [X] `src/worker.py` async processing for one file, using the pre-computed header map.
    - [X] Fetch only data rows (skip header row) for efficiency.
- [X] `src/lambda_handler.py` thin adapter with AWS Powertools integration.
- [X] Stream results to S3 using standard upload (optimized for <50MB).
- [X] Emit `logger.error("Error: Processing {file}")` for each failed sheet (CloudWatch metric filter).
- [X] Implement structured logging (`json.dumps`) and `log_level` env var.
- [X] Put X-Ray & AWS Powertools (tracing, metrics) decorators.

## 4️⃣  Performance & Reliability
- [X] Batch Sheets requests to honour 100 QPS limit with 100ms delays.
- [X] Implement retry with exponential backoff for 5XX & 429 errors.
- [X] Guard against runaway memory – limit list sizes & clear caches.
- [X] Header mapping optimization (read once, reuse for all files).
- [X] Add CloudWatch alarms: invocation errors, duration %, concurrent executions.

## 5️⃣  Security
- [X] **Workload Identity Federation** instead of service account keys (major security improvement).
- [X] Enforce TLS 1.2 for outbound Google APIs.
- [X] Enable S3 bucket encryption and block public access.
- [X] Audit IAM for least privilege via proper role configuration.

## 6️⃣  Observability
- [X] Configure structured logs & sampling.
- [X] Emit custom metrics: files_processed, rows_emitted, api_error_rate.
- [X] Add Powertools tracer & correlation IDs.
- [X] CloudWatch monitoring with metric filters and alarms.

## 7️⃣  Quality Gate
- [X] Pre-commit hooks: black, isort, flake8, mypy (configured in requirements.txt).
- [X] Comprehensive testing with import validation and functionality tests.
- [X] Code quality tools integrated.

## 8️⃣  Documentation
- [X] Comprehensive README with setup instructions and architecture.
- [X] Complete docstrings and inline documentation.
- [X] Workload Identity Federation setup guide (`WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SETUP.md`).

## 🚀  Deployment & Setup Tasks
- [X] **Google Cloud Setup**
    - [X] Create Google Cloud project: `possible-origin-456416-f4`
    - [X] Enable Drive & Sheets APIs
    - [X] Create Workload Identity Pool: `aws-lambda-pool`
    - [X] Create AWS Provider: `aws-lambda-provider`
    - [X] Create service account: `research-data-service@possible-origin-456416-f4.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
    - [X] Configure service account impersonation
    - [X] Share Google Drive folder with service account email
- [X] **AWS Deployment**
    - [X] Create S3 bucket: `research-aggregation`
    - [X] Create IAM role: `research-data-aggregation-role`
    - [X] Deploy Lambda function: `research-data-aggregation`
    - [X] Configure environment variables (excluding reserved `AWS_REGION`)
    - [X] Upload deployment package with simplified dependencies (33.4MB, 5,563 files)
    - [X] Upload mapping files to S3: `mapping/geo_state.csv`, `mapping/tax_cat.csv`

- [ ] Add Slack notifier on failure/success.
- [ ] Cross-account bucket replication / versioning clean-up Lambda.
- [ ] Web dashboard for monitoring processing status and results.
- [ ] API Gateway endpoint for on-demand triggering with parameters.
